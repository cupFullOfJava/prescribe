Hailing from the windy city of chicago, saxophone player Jeremy "Muscle-Man" Brown, didgeridoo player Brandyn "Spud" Deffinbaugh, and hambonist Mitch "See-Saw" Powell exploded onto the music scene in 1971 with their hit record "Ties, Lies and APIs". Their fusion of cool jazz-metal and tuvan throat singing stunned audiences worldwide on their first ever world tour. Following the release of TLA and the completion of their world tour, the band split up, citing artistic differences.
