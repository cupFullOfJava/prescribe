PROJECT MONITORING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS:
	There are several mechanisms that the Starmony group will utilize in order to ensure effective communication and proper maintenance of the code base. As a group, we will meet a minimum of once a week in a formal, face-to-face meeting to discuss the progress of the project, any issues that have arisen and for code review. In addition, the group will maintain regular group-wide electronic communication to ensure that all group members are kept up to date with what progress has been made, short term goals, and current issues. The group will maintain a “TODO” document on the Git repository to ensure that there is effective communication about what current issues are at hand.
	It will be the responsibility of all group members to pull any changes from the remote repository whenever they work on their local branches so any integration issues can be caught early and fixed before they become a larger problem. In turn, it will also be the responsibility of each group member to push any completed changes or additions to the master branch of the remote repository as often as possible. Any works in progress should be maintained in a development branch to ensure a compiling codebase on the master branch at all times.
